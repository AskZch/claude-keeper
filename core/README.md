# Claude Goldfish Prevention System - Revolutionary AI Verification

**The first external verification system that catches AI agents lying in real-time.**

## The Problem This Solves

Every Claude Code user faces "goldfish syndrome":
- Claude claims fixes are complete but breaks working code
- Context loss causes repeated work on solved issues
- False "deployment ready" claims waste hours of debugging
- No way to verify AI agent claims until damage is done

## The Revolutionary Solution

**External verification that runs parallel to Claude** and catches lies before they compound:

```
Claude: "I fixed the vocabulary corruption"
↓
External Verification: "❌ FALSE - system files still corrupted"
↓
You: "Claude, you lied. Fix it properly."
```

## Proven Results

**Real example from SpokenBlade project:**
- Claude claimed vocabulary corruption was fixed
- External verification revealed: source files clean BUT system files still corrupted
- Database remained in ERROR state
- Prevented deployment of broken system

## System Components

### Core Verification Engine
- **claude-lie-detector.sh**: Main verification script that catches false claims
- **Real-time monitoring**: Runs via Task tool integration
- **Independent memory**: Doesn't rely on Claude's context

### Specialized Subagents
- **goldfish-prevention.md**: Prevents repeated work and false completion claims
- **memory-orchestrator.md**: Manages complete memory ecosystem across sessions
- **Direct MCP access**: Can save/restore state independently

### Enhanced Hook System
- **Smart context monitoring**: Estimates usage via multiple heuristics
- **Auto-compact triggers**: 75% (save state) and 85% (prep compaction)
- **Coordinated injection**: Prevents spam while maintaining continuity

### Memory Persistence
- **Memory-keeper MCP integration**: Persistent storage across sessions
- **Checkpoint system**: Auto-saves before compaction
- **State restoration**: Seamless handoffs between sessions

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code with Task tool access
- Memory-keeper MCP server configured
- External AI CLI (codex, python3, or curl for API calls)

### Quick Setup
1. Copy all files to your project's `.claude/` directory
2. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`
3. Configure memory-keeper session ID in scripts
4. Test with: `./claude-lie-detector.sh full`

### Integration with Existing Projects
Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:
```markdown
## Goldfish Prevention System
- Memory-keeper session: [your-session-id]
- Use Task tool for external verification
- Run lie detector before major changes
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Verification
```bash
# Before Claude makes changes:
Task: ./claude-lie-detector.sh save-state

# After Claude claims success:
Task: ./claude-lie-detector.sh verify-claims
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor vocabulary system:
Task: ./claude-lie-detector.sh vocabulary

# Check corrections functionality:
Task: ./claude-lie-detector.sh corrections
```

### Parallel AI Verification
```bash
# Use external models for verification:
Task: codex "verify this database has correct entry count"
Task: python3 verify-with-openai.py "check if API endpoints work"
```

## Monetization Opportunities

## Technical Architecture

### Memory Layers
1. **Memory-Keeper MCP**: Persistent across all sessions
2. **Project state files**: `.devdata/current_state.md`
3. **TodoWrite system**: Active task tracking
4. **Hook injection**: Real-time context

### Verification Pipeline
1. **Save state** before Claude acts
2. **Monitor changes** in real-time
3. **Verify claims** with external tools
4. **Challenge lies** immediately
